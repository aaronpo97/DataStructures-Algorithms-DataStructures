### Linear
In a *linear container*, all elements are organized in a straight line, with each element having a unique predecessor and successor. 

### Non-linear
In a *non-linear container*, all elements are organized in a heirarchy or a network. Each item may have only one predecessor but many successors (e.g. binary-tree).
